- ⚡ Fun fact: The concept of "Tsundoku": "Tsundoku" is a Japanese term that refers to the act of acquiring books and letting them pile up, often without reading them. It combines elements of tsunde-oku (to let things pile up) and dokusho (reading books). This term highlights a common behavior among book lovers and collectors, reflecting a desire for knowledge and the anticipation of future reading. It raises interesting questions about our relationship with information and the value we place on the potential for learning, even if we don't immediately engage with the materials we collect.
